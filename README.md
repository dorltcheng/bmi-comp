Team Members: Coraline Beitone, Dorothy Cheng, Marco Cheng

We implement three different trajectory decoding methods: Averaging Estimation (`averaging`), Kalman Filtering (`kalman`) and Linear Regression (`regression`). To test it, please put the following command in the MATLAB command window:

* Averaging Estimation: `testFunction_for_students_MTb('averaging')`
* Kalman Filtering: `testFunction_for_students_MTb('kalman')`
* Linear Regression: `testFunction_for_students_MTb('regression')`
